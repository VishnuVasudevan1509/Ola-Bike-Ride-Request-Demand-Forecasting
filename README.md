# 🛵 Ola Bike Ride Request Demand Forecasting

A machine learning-powered forecasting system built using Python that predicts the hourly demand for Ola bike ride bookings based on various environmental and temporal factors. The system performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, and EDA visualizations to uncover patterns in bike rental behavior, enabling efficient resource allocation and fleet optimization.

## 📊 Model Details

The forecasting system uses:
- Linear Regression models for hourly demand prediction.
- Stacked ensemble models to refine predictions using Level-1 model outputs.
- Root Mean Square Log Error (RMSLE) as the evaluation metric for all models.
- Split-specific models for Working Days and Non-Working Days to improve accuracy.

## 📈 Data Insights & Visualizations

- 📅 Peak demand on working days occurs at 8 AM and 5 PM, aligned with office commutes.
- 🛣️ Non-working days show steady demand throughout the day with a noon peak.
- 🌤️ Rentals highest in clear weather and during Fall and Summer seasons.
- 🌡️ Demand rises with temperature (32°C–36°C ideal for biking) and falls with high humidity.
- 📊 Correlation analysis reveals strong positive influence of temperature on rentals and negative influence of humidity.
